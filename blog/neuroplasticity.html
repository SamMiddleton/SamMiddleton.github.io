    <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
    <p>
      Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to rewire itself.
      It is often said that "Neurons that fire together wire together", 
      i.e. if adjacent neurons respond to a stimulus together, 
      their connection will strengthen to make it easier for them to respond together in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the early 1900's, it was understood that the brain developed, but it was thought it only happened during childhood.
      It took until the 1970's for it to be accepted that the brain continued deveoping in adulthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has also been discovered that imagining doing a thing uses the same neural pathways in your brain as actually doing the thing.
      As neural pathways get reinforced when they are used, this means that <em>imagining doing a thing helps you get better at it!</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      In a study where 2 groups of people practiced playing piano, with one group only doing so mentally, 
      after 3 weeks, mental practice provided comparable improvement to physical practice!
      Mental practice began to fall behind in effectiveness after 5 weeks, 
      but the people who had been doing mental practice could still catch up quickly if they started physical practice.
    </p>
    <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
    <p>
      Just as imagining doing a skill helps you get better at it, 
      believing you can improve helps you improve while believing that your abilities are inherent and fixed leads to stagnation.
    </p>

      In a study by Carol Dweck, one of the pioneers of growth mindset reserch, teenage students were given a challenging test.
      Students who did well were told either "Congratulations, you must be really smart!" or "Congratulations, you must have worked really hard!"
      Students that were praised for ability rather than effort were more likley to shy away from additional challenges and also to lie about their results.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fixed mindset is particularly problematic in relationships, as it leads to the conclusion that
      problems in a relationship are due to inherent flaws in you or your partner(s) which cannot be changed,
      inevitably leading to disillusionment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's important to bear in mind that just because you have a growth mindset about some subjects
      doesn't mean you don't still have a fixed mindset about other subjects.
