    <h1>Thoughts on the Core Curriculum</h1>
    <h2>Three things I've learnt about me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I sometimes have trouble putting thoughts into words.</li>
      <li>I find meditation quite dull.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of confidence in my programming ability and can get smug if I think I've done something particularly clever.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Values, Empathy & Self-Awareness in Learning and Programming</h2>
    <p>
      Self-awareness as to your limitations and how you learn best is obviously beneficial to learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's important for programmers to have good values and strong ethics because we may end up making systems for handling important data.
    </p>
    <h2>Surprises about core learning</h2>
    <p>
      I was most surprised by some of the consequences of fixed mindsets that have been shown by studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: 40% of kids who did well on a challenging test, but were praised for their ability rather than effort lied a bout their results.
    </p>
    <h2>Challenges of core learning</h2>
    <p>
      The most difficult part of core learning for me has been putting stuff into words.
      I often end up with vauge thoughts that conflict with my desire to be consise.
    </p>
    <h2>Core learning at DevAcademy</h2>
    <p>
      DevAcademy teaches core skills because they are prized by employers.
      This has been effectively communicated, so it does not feel like a waste of time.
