        <h2>Devveron2.0</h2>
        <p>My final project at Dev Academy, a online multiplayer texed-based adventure game.</p>
        <p>It uses React, Express, Knex & Socket.io</p>
        <p>I learnt how to use websockets for features like the chat, and had fun using it in place of an internal API</p>

        <h2>Dive Trip Planner</h2>
        <p>Another project I did at Dev Academy, a system for organising a dive</p>
        <p>It uses React, Redux, Express & Knex</p>
        <p>This project gave me a lot of experience with many-to-many relationships. It proved to be a bit big for a one-day project, even though we focused entirely on functionality over styling.</p>

        <h2>TagBot</h2>
        <p>I designed, built and programmed some LEGO robots to collect data on the effectiveness of various PIT tags for a research paper with my father</p>
        <p>The robots were programmed with python 2 and nxt-python.</p>
