    <h1>Intro to Javascript</h1>
    <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>If a website was a robot arm, HTML would be the trusses that make up its structure, 
      CSS would be panelling that makes it look nice and JavaScript would be the motors that make it move.</p>
    <p>Javascript provides interactivity to websites, where HTML provides the content and structure and CSS provides the styling.</p>
    <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
    <p>To do complex interactivity, it is often necessary to do things only sometimes,
        for example <code>IF the laundry basket is full THEN put a wash on</code>.</p>
    <p>It is also useful to choose between options, e.g. 
      <code>IF more than half the dirty laundry is white THEN put a white wash on ELSE put a coloured wash on</code></p>
    <p>You can also do things several times with loops, such as <code>FOR EACH piece of clothing IN the clean laundry DO fold it</code></p>
    <p>Another form of loop is the while loop, which could look like this:
      <code>WHILE the bedsheet is more than 50cm on any side DO fold it in half</code>
    </p>
    <h3>The <em>Document Object Model</em></h3>
    <p>The Document Object Model, or DOM is a representation of the webpage's structure in a form that can be understood and manipulated by JavaScript code.</p>
    <p>The following code, for example, finds the element with the ID of <code>foo</code> and sets the function <code>bar</code> to be called whenever the element is clicked (functions are explained below).</p>
    <blockquote><pre><code>el = document.querySelector('#foo')
el.addEventListener('click', bar)</code></pre></blockquote>
    <h3>Arrays and Objects</h3>
    <p>There are two basic ways to store a collection of things in JavaScript: Arrays and Objects.</p>
    <p>An array is a list of values, e.g. <code>arr = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']</code>.</p>
    <p>Elements of an array can be retrieved and modified by <em>indexing</em>, counting the elements from 0 so <code>a = arr[1]</code> assigns <code>'bar'</code> to <code>a</code> and <code>arr[2] = 'foobar'</code> sets the last element of the array to <code>'foobar'</code>.</p>
    <p>Objects store information in key-value pairs like so: <code>obj = {a:1, b:1, c:2, d:3, e:5}</code> and are accessed like <code>foo = obj.d</code>.</p>
    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <p>A function is a self contained block of code that can be reused, e.g.</p>
    <blockquote><pre><code>function collatz(num) {
  let result
  if (num % 2 === 0) {
    result = num / 2
  } else {
    result = 3*num + 1
  }
  return result
}</code></pre></blockquote>
    <p>If we then call the function like <code>a = collatz(10)</code>, then <code>num</code> is assigned the value <code>10</code> and the function's code is executed.</p>
    <p>As 10 has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, the first branch of the <code>if-else</code> is executed and <code>result</code> is assigned the value <code>5</code>.</p>
    <p>We then <code>return result</code> so the function exits and <code>5</code> gets assigned to <code>a</code>.</p>
    <p>Functions are useful because they save us from having to write out the same code again and again, and they can abstract away implementation details from higher-order logic.</p>
