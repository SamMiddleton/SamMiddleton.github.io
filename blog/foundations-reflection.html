    <h1>Thoughts on the Core Curriculum</h1>
    <h2>Three things I've learnt about me</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I sometimes have trouble putting thoughts into words.</li>
      <li>I find meditation quite dull. I find that it dosen't seem to make me more aware of my body than I am most of the time and I find my thoughts constantly running off on tangents.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of confidence in my programming ability and can get smug if I think I've done something particularly clever.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Values, Empathy & Self-Awareness in Learning and Programming</h2>
    <p>
      Self-awareness as to your limitations and how you learn best is obviously beneficial to learning, helping you know what skills you need to work on and how to do so most effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Empathy is also effective in education because it helps you work together better on group projects and because if you help someone out with something their struggling with, they may be able to help you later when you struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's important for programmers to have good values and strong ethics because we may end up making systems for handling important data.
    </p>
    <h2>Surprises about core learning</h2>
    <p>
      I was most surprised by some of the consequences of fixed mindsets that have been shown by studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: 40% of kids who did well on a challenging test, but were praised for their ability rather than their effort lied about their results.
    </p>
    <p>
      This surprised me with how easy it was to lead kids into a fixed mindset and how far kids would go in keeping up appearances.
    </p>
    <h2>Challenges of core learning</h2>
    <p>
      The most difficult part of core learning for me has been putting stuff into words.
      I often end up with vauge thoughts that conflict with my desire to be consise.
    </p>
    <h2>Core learning at DevAcademy</h2>
    <p>
      DevAcademy teaches core skills because they are prized by employers, because a jerkass genius is still a jerk and most projects these days are too complex to not work with other people.
      This has been effectively communicated, so it does not feel like a waste of time.
      I was familiar with a lot of the concepts that were covered, but I still learned some new and interesting things.
      Also, as I am already experienced with the basics of programming, I did not feel the need to focus more on that.
