      <h1>Ethics</h1>
      <p>Once a slightly bedraggled man shouted incoherently at me as I put some trash in the bin at a bus interchange. We ended up sitting next to each other on the bus and he engaged me in conversation about the music I was listening to, then asked me to help him set up an app on his phone and I helped him out.</p>
      <p>I had to choose between avoiding someone who made me feel uncomfortable and being polite & helpful, obviously choosing the latter.
      I also took care to tell him how I was setting up his app and to get him to confirm he wanted to give it his payment information.
      </p>
      <p>Overall, I remain satisfied with my choice.</p>

      <h1>Culture & Identity</h1>
      <p>Growing up going to church regularly has given me a strong sense of christian moral philosophy.</p>
      <p>Being born in the United States, living until I was 6 in the Falkland Islands and then moving to New Zealand has left me with very little sense of Nationalism.</p>
      
      <h1>Strengths</h1>
      <p>My top 5 strengths on the VIA survey are Love of Learning, Judgement, Curiosity, Prudence and Kindness.</p>
      <p>A Love of Learning and Curiosity are obviously useful in an educational context.</p>
      <p>Kindness will help me get on with teammates on group projects.</p>
      <p>Judgement and Prudence will help me make good decisions.</p>

      <h1>Limitations</h1>
      <p>I have a bit of a tendency to procrastinate, especially if I have a lot of different things I need to do.</p>
      <p>My aversion to takling myself up has made it a lot harder to look for work.</p>
      <p>My urge to be concise means I often have trouble writing about things i have complex, uncertain thoughts about.</p>

      <h1>Colaborating</h1>
      <p>In a group project I had at Uni, it became clear that my partner had very little idea about how to do the assigned tasks. I walked him through the steps he needed to take to do the easy task and took the hard task for myself. This approach managed to get the assignment done well. If I were to do it again, I would also try to explain how I solved the hard task once I did so.</p>
