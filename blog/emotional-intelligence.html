      <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
      <p>Emotional Intelligence, or EQ, is "The ability to monitor one’s own and other’s feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions." <cite>Salovey and Mayer 1990</cite></p>
      <p>It used to be thought that intelligence was the be all and end all of success, however it tuned out that even if you're a genius, being a jerk is a hinderance to success.</p>
      <p>This change in attitude could in part be caused by the increasing complexity of technology making it more necessary to colaborate for success.</p>
