    <h1>Long Term Goal</h1>
    <p>I would like to get a job where I can solve interesting problems.</p>
    <p>Ideally, it'd be fairly practical, but software engineering would be OK.</p>

    <h1>Strengths and Limitations</h1>
    <h3>Strengths</h3>
    <p>My top 5 strengths on the VIA survey are Love of Learning, Judgement, Curiosity, Prudence and Kindness.</p>
    <p>A Love of Learning and Curiosity are obviously useful in an educational context.</p>
    <p>Kindness will help me get on with teammates on group projects.</p>
    <p>Judgement and Prudence will help me make good decisions.</p>

    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <p>I have a bit of a tendency to procrastinate, especially if I have a lot of different things I need to do.</p>
    <p>My aversion to takling myself up has made it a lot harder to look for work.</p>
    <p>My urge to be concise means I often have trouble writing about things i have complex, uncertain thoughts about.</p>

    <h1>Skills I'd like to develop</h1>
    <p>I'm really interested to learn about using databases.</p>
    <p>I'd also like to make my CV better and get better at doing cover letters and interviews.</p>

    <h1>Managing my Workload</h1>
    <p>I will be on time and get plenty of sleep.</p>
    <p>If the work ends up piling up a bit, I can take a break from my social activities, which should otherwise provide some stress relief.</p>

    <h1>Getting Help</h1>
    <p>I will ask for help from facilitators on Discord, or in person at bootcamp.</p>

    <h1>Expectations of Facilitators</h1>
    <p>To be helpful and provide guidance.</p>

    <h1>Scheduling</h1>
    <p>I have a couple of social events that I would like to keep attending if possible:</p>
    <p>Friday Night Magic on Fridays at 6.</p>
    <p>Role Playing Games with friends on Saturdays from 11 to 4ish.</p>
